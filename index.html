	<h2>About me:</h2>
	<p>Iâ€™m a passionate guitarist and musician who started learning guitar at the age of 5. 
		Iâ€™ve received professional training both in India and in the USA. Over the years,
		Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to play and perform as a professional guitarist at national and international events, 
		conferences, competitions, and festivals. One of my recent highlights was performing at the inauguration ceremony 
		of the North America Bengali Associationâ€™s 25th annual conference in New Jersey, where 
		I proudly represented India by opening with the Indian national anthem!
		I teach guitar to students of all ages and cultural backgrounds, and I run my own YouTube channel, 
		MusiCraft â€“ Music Therapy (www.youtube.com/@MusiCraft09). Giving back to the community is something 
		I deeply value. I regularly perform at senior centers and on special occasions for children with special needs during 
		the holidays. Iâ€™ll be teaching beginner and intermediate guitar classes for both children and adults.</p>
